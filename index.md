<h1>Cockatiels</h1>

<p>The <strong>cockatiel</strong> <em>(Nymphicus hollandicus)</em>, also known as <strong>miniature cockatoo, 

weero</strong>, or <strong>quarrion</strong>, is a bird that is a member of its own branch of the cockatoo 

family endemic to Australia. They are prized as household pets and companion parrots throughout the world and 

are relatively easy to breed. As a caged bird, cockatiels are second in popularity only to the budgerigar.</p>

<p>The cockatiel is the only member of the genus Nymphicus. It was previously considered a crested parrot or 

small cockatoo; however, more recent molecular studies have assigned it to its own subfamily, Nymphicinae. It 

is, therefore, now classified as the smallest of the Cacatuidae (cockatoo family). Cockatiels are native to 

Australia, favouring the Australian wetlands, scrublands, and bushlands.</p>
