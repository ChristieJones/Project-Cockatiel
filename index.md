<h1>Cockatiel</h1>
<p>The <strong>cockatiel</strong> <em>(Nymphicus hollandicus)</em>, also known as <strong>miniature cockatoo, weero,</strong> or <strong>quarrion</strong>, is a bird that is a member of its own branch of the cockatoo family endemic to Australia. They are prized as household pets and companion parrots throughout the world and are relatively easy to breed. As a caged bird, cockatiels are second in popularity only to the budgerigar.</p> <p>The cockatiel is the only member of the genus <strong>Nymphicus</strong>. It was previously considered a crested parrot or small cockatoo; however, more recent molecular studies have assigned it to its own subfamily, <em>Nymphicinae</em>. It is, therefore, now classified as the smallest of the Cacatuidae (cockatoo family). Cockatiels are native to Australia, and favour the Australian wetlands, scrublands, and bush lands.</p>
